Build Alithia Engine with OpenWatcom
------------------------------------

To build the Alithia Engine with OpenWatcom you need a recent version of the
OpenWatcom package (at http://openwatcom.org/ you can find the latest version)
for Windows, my LIL library (for the LIL interpreter) and SDL.

You need to build LIL before OpenWatcom so that the .tgt file can find it. LIL
must be placed at the same parent directory as the Alithia Engine's sources in
a directory named lil, like:

  <somewhere>
       |
       +-- lil
       |
       `-- alithia

Since OpenWatcom uses its own register-based calling convention you also need
to compile SDL from sources. The latest SDL version should compile with no or
minimal modifications (there are instructions included - for SDL 1.2.14 i had
to add a || defined(__WATCOMC__) in the sdl_config_win32.h file to build it
because the version of OpenWatcom that the Makefile was written for - 1.5 -
did not had stdint.h available).

Note that the resulting DLL will be incompatible with the publically available
SDL.DLL file available from libsdl.org. I think you can generate a compatible
SDL.DLL by changing the configuration for the compiler in the Makefile, but by
doing so you will need to reconfigure both LIL and Alithia Engine to use stack
based calls and will lose a bit of optimizations that OpenWatcom does.

Once you have SDL built, just open the LIL and Alithia Engine project files
(LIL first, Alithia Engine next) and build all their targets via the
OpenWatcom IDE.
