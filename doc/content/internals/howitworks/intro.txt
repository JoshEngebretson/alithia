Introduction
<!--@weight=100-->
<p>This document describes how the <strong>Alithia Engine</strong> is designed, implemented and generally <em>works</em>. This document is written by <em>Kostas &#8220;Bad Sector&#8221; Michalopoulos</em>.</p>

<h2>Please Note</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that the engine is under heavy development and in early stages. This document will be also heavily modified, extended and have a great lag in updates. At this moment the best source for up-to-date information is actually the engine&#8217;s own source code.</p>
