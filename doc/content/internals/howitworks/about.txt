About Alithia Engine
<!--@weight=200-->
<p><strong>Alithia Engine</strong> is is a 3D game engine written by <strong>Runtime Terror</strong>, which basically means me, <em>Kostas Michalopoulos</em>. The engine is designed in a straightforward manner with implementation simplicity and fast content creation being the major goals. It includes both a game mode and an editing mode and editing can be done mostly from inside the engine &#8211; including creating maps, placing entities and editing scripts.</p>

<p>The engine is written in plain portable C and compiled using the <span class="caps">GNU</span> C Compiler under Mac OS X, Windows and Linux platforms. For portability, the engine uses the OpenGL graphics <span class="caps">API</span> and the Simple Directmedia Layer (<span class="caps">SDL</span>) library for handling system-specific resources, input and output (except graphics, of course). All development is currently done using the Eclipse <span class="caps">IDE</span> and most of the work is done under Mac OS X with some parts under Ubuntu and Windows. To drive the build process, a custom configuration script is written in Python which generates a Makefile for <span class="caps">GNU</span> Make. The Blender 2.5 exporter tool is also written using Python.</p>

<p>A big development decision is to keep 3rd party dependencies to a minimum. 3rd party dependenceis are libraries, tools and code written by somebody other than the main developer (Kostas Michalopoulos). This is done to make sure that the developers have full control and understanding of all the code for the engine. To save development time where needed and to take advantage of existing libraries, custom resource formats are used in the engine and external tools are used to convert resources to the custom formats. This way we can utility libraries such as libpng, libjpeg, etc without having an engine dependency on these libraries, thus keeping the engine lightweight (at the moment, however, we only use <span class="caps">SDL</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">BMP</span> loading routines which so far are enough for our needs).</p>

<p>Our motto is <em>*Dependencies Suck!*</em></p>
