Introduction
<!--@weight=1 @default-->
<p><strong>Alithia Engine</strong> is is a 3D game engine written by <strong>Runtime Terror</strong>, which basically means me, <em>Kostas Michalopoulos</em>. The engine is designed in a straightforward manner with implementation simplicity and fast content creation being the major goals. It includes both a game mode and an editing mode and editing can be done mostly from inside the engine &#8211; including creating maps, placing entities and editing scripts.</p>
