How to build Alithia Engine
---------------------------

1. Prerequisites
  Alithia Engine depends on very little software to be built:

    for SCons building, it needs SCons from http://www.scons.org/

    for Makefile building, it needs GNU Make from
    http://www.gnu.org/software/make/

    both methods require a UNIX-like environment (MSYS will fit the bill
    under Windows) with a GCC-based toolchain (MinGW will fit the bill
    under Windows). It might compile under other compilers, i haven't
    checked yet.

    Also Python 2.x (not 3.x!) is required.

    The Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is used for cross-platform support.
    It can be obtained from http://www.libsdl.org/. The installation must
    be done in such a way that the SDL include directory is placed in a
    directory inside the compiler's default include path because the 
    engine does not use sdl-config to figure out where SDL is installed
    (since sdl-config sometimes fails under Windows) and includes the
    needed header files directly like

      #include <SDL/SDL.h>

2. SCons builds
  Note that SCons will be removed in a future commit and might be broken
  in some OSes.

  To build with SCons just type

    scons

  at the root of the source tree. Then wait.

3. Makefile builds
  To build with GNU Make first run the ./configure.py script which will
  create the Makefile

    ./configure.py

  then run make

    make

  If everything is ok, a file named atest will be created in the root of
  the source tree (under Windows this will be atest.exe).
