Alithia Package (ALP) File Format
---------------------------------

1. Description of archive
  Alithia Package files (ALP files) are simple uncompressed archives with a
  flat directory of archived files and raw data. The directory is made up of
  entries that contain the file name with its full path (relative to the
  archive), its absolute position in the package file and its size in bytes.

2. File layout
  The package is made up of three parts: the header, the raw data and the
  directory. The directory always cames at the end of the file. There is no
  information about number of files in the directory - the whole directory until
  the end of the file must be read.
  
  All integer numbers are in little endian.

  Header:
  4 bytes   for the 'ALP1' string
  1 uint32  position of the directory in the file
  
  ( raw data follows )
  
  Directory:
  for each entry until the end of the file:
  1 uint16  filename's length in bytes
  len bytes filename string
  1 uint32  file's absolute position in the file
  1 uint32  file's length in bytes

3. Source code
  Check the tools/alpak/alpak.c code. The program is rather small at about 165
  lines of code and very readable.
